# TIC TAC TOE - Project 0

## My First Project at General Assembly Sydney _Software Engineering Immersive Course_ of Week 3 out of 12

### What I've learned

-I was able to use the **command line** and **source control** to interact with the computer to access files and save changes to code with a git repository
-I was able to apply my knowledge of the fundamentals learned from the 1st 2 weeks such as making functions, working with objects and arrays, jQuery event handlers, problem-solving and debugging.
-I was able to deploy my site online and share my work.

### Goals Unlocked

- [x] Render a game board in the browser
- [x] Switch turns between X and O or any symbol the player inputs
- [x] Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or draw if neither wins
- [x] Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS
- [x] Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
- [x] Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- [x] Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- [ x]Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter

### To improve or to do list

- [ ] Make the game mobile responsive
- [ ] Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

Languages used:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript/jQuery

To access the game, go to [shaneenvitug.github.io/project0](shaneenvitug.github.io/project0)

To play: input player 1's name and character(either X or O, or any symbol) then press add player. Do the same for player 2's name and character. Then click on the grid alternately per player until one wins and gets 3 in a row or draw if none. The wins counter will track the score and reset wins button can reset the score. New game will restart everything. Pretty simple, right? Have fun!
